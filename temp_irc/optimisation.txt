// DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS FILE (i ll solve all this)

IRC dirrectory:

- Perhabs is more modular to use defines for namespace names
- PRIORIZE ALL INTER-CLASS static implementations

AMessage.hpp
- better if prefix class has const members
- to create an empty string use std::string default constructor
- prefix iterator constructor does not init members
- pattern repetition in prefix iterator constructor
- prefix::serialize might return const and pattern repetition
- prefix::length pattern repetition

Channel.hpp
- Constructor signature could be better
- MUST use bitwise for flags
- pattern repetition can be avoided in Channel::isOperator to Chanel::isStatusInvite
- and those must be inline 

Client.hpp
- MUST use bitwise for member bools in ClientModes
- ClientModes doesn't need the declaration(/definition) of this constructor/destructor
- Some pattern repetition that can be avoided and some function members can be inline
- And perhabs, some pointers pointed addresses can be const

Database.hpp
- Perhabs inherit properties in a better way (that not optimization)
- Member function can be more readable using a loop with static local variables and be inline

Message.hpp
- I ve stopped here
